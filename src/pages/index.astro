			I'm a senior from Mississauga (near Toronto) who loves public
			transit, urban planning, books (a little bit of everything), reading
			magazines and newspapers, programming (sometimes), running/building
			online communites, and running <p id="holder">hackathons</p>
			<span id="expand" class="bold-link"
				>[(I've organized 3 hackathons in Toronto, and helped with 2
				other hackathons in Vermont & New Delhi!)]</span
			>
			 I also enjoy doing sound for school events whenever I get the chance
			^.^
		</p>
		<p>
			Most people think I'm an introvert, but I'm an extrovert forced to
			be an introvert. My friends say I'm good at small talk, which I find
			ooldy fitting. In my free time, I like spending time with my
			friends, working on projects, watching netflix, listening to music,
			and playing with my siblings
		</p>
		<p>
			Currently, I'm trying to start a blog on Mississauga City Hall &
			Ontario Politics <span id="box"> this is a test</span>, at <a
				href="https://mississauga.report"
				class="bold-link">Mississauga Report</a
			>, and trying to figure out how to get more involved in politics.
		</p>
		<p>
			I also work at <a href="https://hackclub.com" class="bold-link">
				Hack Club
			</a> where I lead community operations overseeing & helping with virtual
			events, fraud, newsletters and a little bit of everything else! I also
			co-lead the moderation dept for a community of 40,000+ teenagers ðŸ™ˆ
		</p>
		<p>
			This May, I helped organize <a
				class="bold-link"
				href="https://apocalypse.hackclub.com">Apocalypse.</a
			> Apocalypse was a labour of love, a hackathon me and a few friends came
			up with in Septmember 2023, and it ended up becoming Canada's largest
			High School hackathon EVER
