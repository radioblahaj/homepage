		<h1> Hi, I'm <span id="random"> Arav</span> <code> (he/him)</code></h1>
		<i> "I'm young, scrappy, and hungry; I'm not throwing away my shot!" ~ Hamilton</i>
		<p> This is a very <i> unfinished website</i>, so sorry in advance!</p>
		<p> I'm a senior from Mississauga (near Toronto) who loves public transit, urban planning, books (a little bit of everything), reading magazines and newspapers, programming (sometimes), running/building online communites, and <a class="bold-link" href="/hackathons">running hackathons.</a> I also enjoy doing sound for school events whenever I get the chance ^.^ </p>
		<p> My friends say I'm good at small talk, which I find ironic. I'm an extrovert forced to be an introvert. I should talk more, and smile more.  b. In my free time, I like spending time with my friends, working on projects, watching netflix, listening to music, and playing with my siblings</p>
		<p> Currently, I'm trying to start a blog on Mississauga City Hall & Ontario Politics <span id="box"> this is a test</span>, at <a href="https://mississauga.report" class="bold-link">Mississauga Report</a>, and trying to figure out how to get more involved in politics. </p>
		<p> I also work at Hack Club where I lead community operations helping with virtual events, fraud, newspaper/newsletter teams and a little bit of everything else. I also co-lead the moderation dept for a community of 40,000+ teenagers! </p>
		<p> This May, I helped organize <a class="bold-link" href="https://apocalypse.hackclub.com">Apocalypse.</a> Apocalypse was a labour of love, a hackathon me and a few friends came up with in Septmember 2023, and it ended up becoming Canada's largest High School hackathon EVER </p>

	<p> See you around, Arav</p>
