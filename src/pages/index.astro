		<p>
			I'm a senior from Mississauga (near Toronto) who loves public
			transit, urban planning, books (a little bit of everything), reading
			magazines and newspapers, doing sound for school events
			^.^ programming (sometimes), running/building
			online communities, and running <span id="holder">[hackathons]</span>! 
			<span id="expand">(I've organized 3 hackathons in Toronto, and helped with 2 other hackathons in Vermont & New Delhi!)</span>
			
		</p>

		<p> I also sometimes write musings on things I've done or find interesting, you can find my <a class="bold-link" href="https://blog.radioblahaj.com"> blog </a> here! </p>

		<p>
			 In my free time, I like spending time with my
			friends, working on projects, watching netflix, listening to music,
			and playing with my siblings
		</p>
		
		<p>
<p>
right now, I'm trying to build <a href="https://lu.ma/blahajdiy" class="bold-link"> BlahajDIY </a>, an event incubucator for whimiscal and diverse events for young adults in Toronto! I'm also experimenting with side projects like <a href="https://github.com/radioblahaj/airport" class="bold-link"> Airport </a>, a terminal utility to view detailed light data for flights near you (by IATA code). Before this summer is over, I want to make some small tools for local Mississauga stuff hopefully :)
</p> 
			I also used to work at <a href="https://hackclub.com" class="bold-link">
				Hack Club
			</a> where I lead community operations overseeing & helping with virtual
			events, fraud, newsletters and a little bit of everything else! I also
			co-lead the moderation dept for a community of 60,000+ teenagers ðŸ™ˆ
		</p>
		<p>
			Last May, I helped organize <a
				class="bold-link"
				href="https://apocalypse.hackclub.com">Apocalypse.</a
			> Apocalypse was a labour of love, a hackathon me and a few friends came
			up with in Septmember 2023, and it ended up becoming Canada's largest
			High School hackathon EVER
