                I'm an 17 year old from Mississauga who is a aspiring polymath,
                a jack of all trades, master of none. I love going on random
                rabbit holes and making all sorts of cool projects in my free
                time :)
            </p>
            I'm currently a freshman at York University > majoring in Interdisciplinary
            Social Science
            <p>
                Some of my interests (in no particular order) include politics,
                urban planning, public transit, programming (sometimes), poetry,
                hackathons & meetups, and communities. I also really love music,
                and you'll often find me with my headphones on or <a

                    songwriting</a
                > at all hours of the day
            </p>
            <!-- <p>
            Quick fun fact: I used to play the drum for 4 years, the flute for
            1.5 years, and the saxophone for 4 months.
        </p> -->

            <p>
                Along the way, I've ran hackathons all over the world, worked at
                <a href="https://hackclub.com/">Hack Club</a> leading community operations,
                spent 6 weeks interning in VT building custom moderation tools and
                virtual events for
                <a href="https://hackclub.com/arcade">Arcade </a>, played the
                drums for 4 years, and <small
                    >ran a podcast from 2021 to 2022 where I interviewed SaaS
                    founders üôà</small
                >
            </p>
            <p>
                Right now, I'm working on starting an event incubator and
                community for whimiscal and curious young makers in Toronto with <a

            I also run a blog and newsletter on Substack, and send emails
