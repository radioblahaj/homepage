# Personal Website

My personal website built with Astro. It has a lot of fun little features like:

- A color changing header (Arav changes colour randomly from a list of 4 colours)
- Expandable text (try clicking on hackathons, I didn't want to yap for hours on my website and make it too much information so I added a button that lets you toggle extra information if you're curios, and toggle it on and off)
- Some custom styling for links and content
- A /now page for people to see what I'm up to right now
